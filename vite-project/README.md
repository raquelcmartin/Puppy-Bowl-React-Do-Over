# Puppy Bowl API

Welcome to the README for the "Puppy Bowl" API project. This document will guide you through the process of utilizing our API to build a React application that showcases information about our adorable puppy competitors, their owners, and the teams they belong to.

## Documentation

You can find the documentation for our "Puppy Bowl" API. Please review the documentation to familiarize yourself with the available routes and the type of data you will be working with in this project.

## Summing It Up

As the web developer for this project, your primary responsibility will be handling data related to each puppy competitor and their owners. You'll interact with our "Puppy Bowl" API to retrieve information about each puppy, its owner, and the teams they are associated with. Subsequently, you'll make requests to the API, store the obtained data in the state of your React app, and then proceed to build various React components to visually represent this data to your users.

## Getting Started

To begin, you'll create a React application from scratch as you won't have a GitHub repository to clone and work from. 

While you'll have creative freedom in visually representing the data, there are specific requirements outlined for this project, which we'll discuss in the next section.

## Additional Requirements

In addition to visually representing the data, there are specific requirements you need to fulfill:

1. **Data Retrieval**: Utilize appropriate requests to fetch data from the "Puppy Bowl" API.
2. **State Management**: Store the fetched data in the state of your React application for efficient rendering.
3. **Component Building**: Create React components to represent various aspects of the data, such as individual puppies, their owners, and teams.
4. **User Interface**: Design an intuitive and visually appealing user interface to display the data.
5. **Error Handling**: Implement error handling mechanisms to gracefully handle API request failures or invalid responses.
6. **Responsiveness**: Ensure that your application is responsive and accessible across different devices and screen sizes.

By fulfilling these requirements, you'll create a delightful user experience while showcasing the adorable participants of the "Puppy Bowl."

Happy coding! üê∂üèà
